How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I test my code to make sure that it fits within the requirements and works in both favorable and unfavorable conditions.

Analyse each user need and make it into a quantifiable requirement. Once that requirment has been met the user need should be met as well.

How do I approach designing software?
I start at the requirements, make sure it works when used as intended, make sure it reacts accordingly when not used as intended, and then add quality of life upgrades.
